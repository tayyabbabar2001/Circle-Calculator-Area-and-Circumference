# Circle-Calculator-Area-and-Circumference
The Circle Calculator is a simple C++ console-based program that allows users to calculate the area and circumference of a circle based on the provided radius 'r'. With the value of 'pi' set to 3.142, this program demonstrates how to perform basic circle-related calculations.

**Features:**

Area Calculation: The program efficiently computes the area of the circle by multiplying 'pi' with the square of the radius 'r'.

Circumference Calculation: By multiplying the radius 'r' with twice the value of 'pi', the calculator accurately determines the circumference of the circle.

**How to Use:**

Run the program.
Enter the radius of the circle when prompted by the console.
The program will immediately process the input and display the calculated area and circumference of the circle.
